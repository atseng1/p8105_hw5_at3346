## Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(species = as.character(species))


iris_func = function(x) { 
  
  if (is.numeric(x)){
      replace(x, is.na(x), round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1))
  }
  
  else {
    replace (x, is.na(x), "virginica")
  }
  
}
  
iris_no_missing = map_df(iris_with_missing, ~iris_func(.x))
```

## Problem 2

``` r
file_names = tibble(
  name = list.files(path = "./data/", all.files = TRUE, no.. = TRUE),
  file_path = str_c("./data/", name))

source_func = function(x){
  read_csv(x)
}

long_study = file_names %>% 
  mutate(source_name = map(file_names$file_path, source_func)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-file_path) %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("study_arm","subject_id", "file_type")) %>%
  select(-file_type)

Based on visually inspecting the spaghetti plot, the weekly observation
values for subjects in the experimental arm of the study are, on
average, greater than the weekly observation values for the control arm
of the study.
